#summary Information on upgraded and modifying hardware

= Upgrades =


There are multiple reports of increasing memory and changing the CPU.

  * [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.asus/msg/e9c4c9bd4fec817e installed 4Gb RAM + AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 5400+]
  * clach04 has installed an extra 2x 2Gb DDR2-800, the existing memory is DDR2-667. According to Memtest86+ 4.10, the 4.5Gb runs at 2699 Mb/s, if the 512Mb is removed the 4Gb of memory runs 3455 MB/s (about 1Mb faster).
  * kieran.levin has installed 2Gb and a dual core CPU


== Memory / RAM ==

http://dava33display.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/static/pics/hddmr9000_x800.jpg

The 4 DDR2 memory slots are located underneath the DVD drive (bottom center of image above ). It may be possible to slide the DIMMS in from the side. I ended up unscrewing the 4 hard drive cage (bottom right) screws, removing the cage (unplugging power and data cable first) and then sliding in the DIMMS from the gap this creates.


== PSU / Power Supply ==

clach04's power supply fan often doesn't rotate on power up (blowing on the fan causes it to start). It probably needs to be replaced at some point.

kieran.levin has replaced his PSU. Details needed!


= Modifications =

  * Cooling enhancements TODO!
      * The CPU/CPU-Fan seem to run OK (40 degrees C). The tuner cards (top right of image above) seem to run very hot. The PSU (top right) seems to be OK. The hard drive (bottom right) seems to run fairly hot 
  * harddrive
      * easy to replace, if using as a DVR, need a fast one that can run 24x7. Seagate DB35 drives are often used for this purpose
      * In theory a 2nd drive could be added to the hard drive cage, BUT this is likely to cause over heating (there is no cooling in that part of the case) and there are no spare power plugs on the factory PSU


= Peripherals =

Regular keyboard/mouse can be plugged into USB ports.

== Remote controls ==

The A33 appears to ship with a number of IR remote devices:
  * Remote for AMP
  * MCE remote
  * keyboard and trackpad

need documentation and model numbers (and suitable replacements/alternatives).

Under Linux LIRC works fine with the remote receiver, so any remote should be usable under Linux (e.g. an old TV remote).
