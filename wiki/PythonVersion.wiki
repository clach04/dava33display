#summary Python version of asusdisplay

= Introduction =

There is now a Pure Python version that relies on [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyusb/ PyUSB]. It has been developed against PyUSB 1.0, so older versions of PyUSB (for example the Ubuntu 10.10 package python-usb is too old). Because of the new PyUSB library, support for different USB libraries is available.

It works on both 32 and 64 bit Linux.

Like the C version, some Linux distributions (like Ubuntu) require root access to access the USB port unless a udev rule is added.
