#summary Information about operating systems, software, and drivers

Booting Ubuntu 11.04 derivatives requires the NOMODESET boot option, when Ubuntu starts booting hit F1 to bring up the boot options. Without the NOMODESET option a black screen is displayed.

Out of box Ubuntu/MythTV ([http://www.mythbuntu.org/ Mythbuntu] 11.04) works fine for everything except the tuner cards. The tuner cards do NOT support NTSC (available in the US over cable) in MythTV, getting digital channels to work requires work. Oddly tvtime can show NTSC channels (without audio).

Linux driver support:

Sound over HDMI requires enabling digital channel in the Mixer.

Some distros may have a minor mismatch in sound settings; audio output only supports sample rate of 48khz - and pulse defaults to 44.1 so you have to force it using "default-sample-rate = 48000" in /etc/pulse/daemon.conf 

== Windows 7 ==

Out of the box every thing works. gfx over hdmi is fine. Sound is fine have to select the correct output device in sound mixer (and set default in Control Panel), viz. "Digital Audio (S/PDIF) High Definition Audio Device" for sound over HDMI to work. Headphone socket shows as a separate device.

Only 3 devices shows as unknown in the Control panel, Device Manager:

  * ASeries Device - Unsure, may be to control amp? Volume control on unit does NOT work in Media center out of box
  * Unknown device (ACPI\ATK0110) - Seen Vista notes on ACPI
  * Unknown device (USB\VID_04E&PID_2009&REV_0000) - probably TFT screen

Drivers are installed for the IR port and the Media Center Start button on the remote starts MCE. It looks like an IR keyboard/mouse would work (based on installed drivers list) but I do not have hardware to confirm that.

The HD Tuners show up.

== Windows Vista ==

Most things work out of the box. The Windows "find driver now" works for the tuner cards (but it is just as easy to download from http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hvr1800.html). Out of the box sound only works through headphones.

The TFT display, IR port, and sound need the A33 drivers. Once installed the TFT displays a clock.

MCE drivers appear to link the IR port and the TFT display.

Sound can be through hdmi, headphones, amp.

Video (over hdmi) works out of the box (but with a pink tinge, i.e. white shows a pink, correct drivers correct this) but drivers can be downloaded from nvida.com (this may be required for audio over hdmi to work, the nvidia control panel has an option to disable audio).

Windows install check list:
